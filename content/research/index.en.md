Tissue remodelling is a biological process that takes place after any kind of injury and aims to restore the normal tissue homeostasis and function. This process involves both the resident and infiltrating cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a complex interplay triggering cell proliferation, ECM remodelling and immune clearance. Dysregulation of this response contributes to the development of fibrosis and cancer due to abnormal accumulation of electrodense extracellular matrix, aberrant cell proliferation and altered immune response. 

Our research seeks to increase our biological understanding around the biological mechanisms controlling the complex interplay between cells and the ECM that takes place during liver fibrosis and cancer, both serious and life-threatening conditions. To address this research question, we employ a wide variety of techniques, including omic analysis of patient and murine samples (proteomics, scRNAseq, bulkRNAseq, etc), several preclinical murine models of pathology, 2D and 3D complex cell culture systems, primary cell cultures and advanced microscopy platforms. 

We have several ongoing research projects focused on understanding the role of immune cells in the progression and resolution of fibrotic diseases as master regulators of both liver and kidney fibrosis. In addition, we are also exploring the contribution of the degradome associated to tumoral and stromal cells to the development and progression of liver cancer. The goal of our research is to discover novel therapeutic targets for drug development to stop, slow-down or even reverse tissue remodelling-associated pathologies, such as fibrosis and cancer.
