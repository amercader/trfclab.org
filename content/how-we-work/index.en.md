## Public Engagement

It is vital for the progress of our research to successfully communicate it
to the public. We regularly participate in several public engagement activities
and deliver talks and workshops at schools.

Below you can find some selected
activities that we have either organized or participated in over the last years.
Some of them are also featured in our [News](/post/) section.

## Mentoring

Our group is committed to the training and development of the younger
generation of scientists and believes it is a fundamental part of our job as
researchers.

We have trained several Master and Postgraduate students, which
have successfully gone on doing their PhDs in Spain and abroad (Newcastle
University, UK; University College of London, UK; Instituto de Neurociencias de
Alicante, Spain; Industrial PhD at Novo Nordisk, Denmark) as well as PhD
students who are currently actively researching in senior positions in both
academia and industry.

Our team provides support to students on a one-by-one
basis, assessing their development needs to reach their personal and
professional goals. As part of broader training activities, our PI regularly
teaches at the Master of Translational Medicine of the University of
Barcelona and is part of PhD examiner’s board in Spain and abroad. In addition, she
also participates in activities organized by CiberEHD and AEEH aimed at improving
the knowledge of young scientists around liver diseases such as the 
[1st CibereHD Research School](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/noticias/idibaps-acoge-la-primera-escuela-de-investigacion-del-ciberehd) and the [AEEH Reunión de Hepatología Traslacional](https://aeeh.es/las-mejores-comunicaciones-presentadas-en-la-6a-reunion-de-hepatologia-traslacional-tienen-premio/).

## Equality

Our PI is member of the Equality Committee at IIBB-CSIC, which aims to promote
equality in the field of biomedical research and improve coexistence within
IIBB-CSIC, guaranteeing non-discrimination based on gender, race, birth,
religion, opinion, identity or sexual orientation and the principle of equal
opportunities.

The Equality Committee is in charge of developing and
implementing the IIBB-CSIC Equality Plan, implementing CSIC Protocol of
prevention and intervention against sexual and gender-based harassment,
distributing news around equality and diversity and organising specific training on
the topic for the IIBB-CSIC personnel. Our committee also belongs to the
Barcelona Equality Committee Network that brings together several Equality and
Diversity Comissions from all the CSIC institutes in the Barcelona area.
