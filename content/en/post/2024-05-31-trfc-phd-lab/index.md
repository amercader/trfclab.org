Paloma, Maria, Julia and Alejandro attend to the PhD Day at IDIBAPS. The event is organized by the PhD community at IDIBAPS and is open to the whole research community. During we were able to listen to stimulating workshops and round table discussions on innovation, sustainability and science communication with experts from academia, communication and industry. We even got lucky in the raffle and Julia won a Lego HPLC!
