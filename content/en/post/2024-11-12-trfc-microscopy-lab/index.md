This week IIBB-CSIC has celebrated the Science Week with conferences and workshops for highschoolers. TRFC Lab did not want to miss the opportunity to inspire the next generation of scientists. For that, Júlia and Alejandro prepared and delivered a workshop on microscopy to nine different groups of students where they visualized normal and disease tissues and learn about fibrotic disease and cancer. In addition, Dr Moles delivered a conference to the student’s title “Regeneration and cancer, two sides of the same coin” where she explained how we work in the lab to answer biological questions related to human disease.
