Our PI, who is member of the IIBB-CSIC Equality Commission, co-organised and chair the Symposium "Professional opportunities with a gender perspective within biomedical research". The Symposium was attended by more than 100 high school students. During the day, gender issues associated with the development of a professional career in the field of biomedical research were addressed, such as the scientific vocation, the gender gap, the glass ceiling, the representation of women in leadership positions and personal conciliation through the testimony of five speakers. The objective of the conference was to highlight the work of our female researchers, promote scientific vocations and raise awareness about gender dimension issues in the field of biomedical research, providing practical tools based on the experience of other women.
