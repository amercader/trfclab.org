This week Maria and Anna have attended to the 2nd International Conference in Liver and Gut Fibrosis. It was an excellent meeting where we had the chance to listen about the latest research advances on liver and gut fibrosis. Maria delivered a selected abstract talk presenting the latest research of the group on the role of macrophage-associated proteolytic enzymes to kidney and liver fibrosis progression.
