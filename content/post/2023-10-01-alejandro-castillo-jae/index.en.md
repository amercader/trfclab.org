We are really happy to announce Alejandro has joined the lab as JAE Intro fellow. These competitive fellowships are aimed at university students interested in starting a research career. This scholarship programme provides an approach to a research career to those students who want to take their first steps in research. JAE Intro grants present the opportunity of enjoying the possibilities offered by CSIC Centres and Institutes in their different scientific areas and, at the same time, they provide an introduction to cutting-edge knowledge of scientific topics and scientific praxis. Welcome to the team Alejandro!
