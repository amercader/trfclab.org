Paloma, Maria and Julia attend to the PhD Day at IDIBAPS. The event is organized by the PhD community at IDIBAPS. During the day Paloma had the opportunity to share her research with her peers with a poster presentation and we were able to listen to inspiring workshops delivered by experts from academia, communication and industry.
