This week Paloma and Maria attended to the 2023 EASL Congress, which
the largest European conference attracting healthcare practitioners, academic researchers and industry participants with interest in all aspects of liver disease. During the conference Maria delivered an oral presentation on her and Palomaâ€™s work on the role of proteolytic enzymes in liver fibrosis. Besides, Paloma also presented also a poster communication at the conference. Really happy with the feedback and the interest raised at the conference by both works.
