Anna and Júlia attended to the AEEH Annual Conference where we had the opportunity to listen the newest advances in clinical and basic research in the hepatology field. During the conference Júlia presented a poster communication about the latest results of her PhD project. Congratulations Júlia! Looking forward to next year’s 50th anniversary of the conference. See you all there!
