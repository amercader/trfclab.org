Data: 26/09/2024

Cos de la noticia: 
We are delighted to share that our paper "Cathepsin D is essential for the degradomic shift of macrophages required to resolve liver fibrosis" is in press now in Molecular Metabolism!

Liver fibrosis is largely acknowledged to be reversible but little is known about the mechanisms controlling ECM remodeling during resolution. 
‚û° Our work shades new light on how macrophages contribute to liver fibrosis resolution. We describe how lysosomal protease CtsD contributes to the macrophage degradomic shift, which comprises secretomic, phenotypical and functional changes, required by macrophages to proteolytically process the ECM during liver fibrosis resolution. 

If you want to know more about CtsD being the new cool kid üòé in the lysosomal block please check out our paper in Molecular Metabolism in the following link:
